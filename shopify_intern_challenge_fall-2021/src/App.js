  // This app is strictly about being a search engine for Movies

    // figure out how to use the search feature to go through the api
    // I Think I can create a seprate component for the search feature 
    // search feature needs to filter through the movies --> check instructions just in case 
  //

  // Creat a separate component for the favorite's list 
    // for this feature I only need both GET and DELETE requests 
    // 
  //
